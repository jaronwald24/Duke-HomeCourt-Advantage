# Duke-HomeCourt-Advantage
As Duke students and avid basketball fans, the craziness behind Cameron Indoor has fascinated us all. Many schools have great basketball programs, but none have a stadium that resembles Cameron. Here at Duke, we have an unparalleled atmosphere that we believe has a relationship with the way in which our team plays, the opposing team plays, and the overall outcome of the game. With this in mind, our group is interested in researching the correlation between playing at Cameron and playersâ€™ performance and quantifying which aspects of their game deviate the most from their performance in other stadiums. 

The research question we want to answer is whether the atmosphere that accompanies Cameron is correlated with the performance of both teams- does our stadium provide us with a true home court advantage? The research is relevant to us because Duke has just gone undefeated at home for the first time since the 2013-2014 season. Many of us in the group regularly attend games, and this project provides an interesting way for us to combine our passion for the sport with data analysis. Choosing a project that is relevant to our lives will also keep us engaged in the project and interested in going beyond simple summary statistics. Finally, Duke basketball is an integral part of this school and its culture - producing this data-driven report would explain some of the drive to go see the games.
